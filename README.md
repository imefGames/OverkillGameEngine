# Overkill

Project Overkill is a home made Game Engine.
The goal of this project for me is to learn as much as possible about game engines.
That is why I wish to make this engine as powerful as possible while relying as little as possible on libraries & the STL.

Planned features for v1
-----------------------
* Full Entity-Component-System model
* Basic 2D & 3D with DirectX (DirectX code is heavily inspired by http://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11.html)
* Rudimentary sound engine
* Data storage in JSon file
* Mono-threaded
* Windows only
* Handling keyboard/mouse only

Current Objectives
------------------
* [FEATURE] Implement fonts
* [FEATURE] Implement sound playing
* [FEATURE] Implement frustum culling
* [FEATURE] Add operators to String/StringView classes
* [REFACTOR] Make generic asset library
* [REFACTOR] Cache component tuple list in systems
* [BUGFIX] The JSon parser fails when encountering empty arrays or objects
* [BUGFIX] Comparing StringView to a char* isn't always done properly (ex: Shader Library)
* [QUALITY] Add Unit tests for classes in the Core folder

Beyond v1
---------
* Game Editor to generate the game data
* Better memory management
* Multi-platform
* Gamepad support
* Multiple threads
* Expanding graphic & sound capabilities
* Implement Physics Engine
* More data storage options (ex: binary files)
* Custom scriting language for Gameplay code
* Network API ?
